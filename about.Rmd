title: "About ME"
---

My name is **Claire**. I am a senior at App State, and have enjoyed my 4 years in Boone! I am a business managment major with a minor in statistics. I want to go into the non-profit sector, and am currently an intern at a local non-profit. I am also interested in companies that do good, even for a profit. An example of one that I particularly like can be found in the **Seventh Generation** tab.
